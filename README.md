# arxiv-email-notifier
This tutorial walks you through creating and setting up a Python script on Ubuntu to automatically fetch and email daily arXiv articles based on specific categories (e.g., hep-ph, astro-ph.HE, nucl-th, quant-ph). The script uses the arxiv Python library, msmtp for email sending, and a cron job for scheduling.
